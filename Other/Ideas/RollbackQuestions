Hi everyone! I am working on a framework with rollback networking and I was wondering if anybody here is open to answering a few questions that I have about this topic?

Cool!

- Does rollback actually solve non-authorative cheating attempts, since only the input is transfered?

- What is a good update time for games using rollback networking (physics FPS / Networking FPS)

- What to do when a client cant keep up with the simulation? Is pausing the only option?

- Why do many games struggle with rollbacks even though they their game state and physics simulation is relatively simple (like fighting games)


TYSM!!! This helps a lot :)

But anyway thank you so much for your time - it is really helpful! Also very nice and informative article, I will definetly check out Jewel Run later (I even bought the premium edition XD)

Introduction

Framework
- Architecture (Needs for deterministic physics, advantages for an ECS (quick iteration)

ECS
- Explanation of ECS and why I am using it 
- Performance test with example of the boids system

Physics
- Architecture considerign the needs for the networking and ECS (not realistic, focus on performance, discrete, determinism)
- Fixed point math (
- Collision Detection using the SAT
- Resolving collision with friction and angular velocity

Networking
- Considerations (
- Architecture (
- Rollback Netcode

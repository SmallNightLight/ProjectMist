not a research report

reflection report - past of evrything
not I for every sentence

write not in chronological order (a bit)

not I did this and then that

explain

Goal: intro: dive into rollback networking -> divide into three components
goal rn

do the milestones later after goal

explain more about rollback , differentent networking architectures, explain why I chose rollback networking, there will always be a delay! why do I 


at the end of report -> cheating

reference to fighting games, competetive market, reliable multiplayer architecture, challenging architecture

an entire diagram, show subset of it (like ECS)

draw conclusions for the reader

dependencies put stuff (at the end, not wordcount, for exmaple entire UML).

The caption would be a title not description
Refere always in text to the image


game diea start of report
Frameork part first


fighting games are a genre that require rollback network. I find that a fascinating genre

scope what is part of the research. dont mention stuff that is not part of the scope (at least not first), just say for myself deptermine scope

After a bit a research -> A common network architecture


The main issues rollback networking
 (
here diagramm (communication diagram), to show the issue

in figure 1 you can see this effect. (Describe isue with figure)

1. Fighting games, networking architecture, personal connection, learning outcomes, plan to set up my research

leave out a few of the details (with the frames), less details

talk about the goals in with the boids (does not need that much introduction with the rollback networking)

diagram smaller
graphs for formula

diagram for packets


conclusion: look back, did I meet the goals, would I use the things I learned in future projects, happy about the approach, was it the right solution?
The goal is not to m
